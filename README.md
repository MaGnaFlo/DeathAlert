# DeathAlert
Simple script to get alerted when some celebrity dies.
This can be useful to follow some artist who can go right back to oblivion without you ever noticing. Then one day you try to look them up, see why no new jam has been released for age. Bam, drug overdose! Classic.
But now you'll know, as long as this person is on Wikipedia, which is relatively common for artists. Of course, this depends on the Wikipedia editor's response. But at least you'll know when they know.
